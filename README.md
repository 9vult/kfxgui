# KFX-GUI

KFX-GUI is a highly extensible graphical karaoke template builder for Advanced Substation Alpha (ASS) subtitles. KFX-GUI does not execute karaoke templates, it only provides a graphical building tool with automation via plugins.

KFX-GUI is currently in very early development and has limited use. Pull/feature requests, especially for creating the stock plugin suite, are welcome.

## Plugins

KFX-GUI uses plugins to represent each possible action in the template. The most basic plugins represent a single ASS tag, such as `\pos` for setting the position or `\border` to add an outline. However, the major benefit to using a plugin system, rather than hardcoding all the tags and their functions, is extensibility. Plugins can easily be created to automate the creation of repetitive actions and effects.

### Creating a plugin

KFX-GUI plugins are written in the TOML format, and are automatically loaded from the plugins folder on startup. An example plugin that creates a grow-and-rotate effect during the syl's duration might look like this:

```toml
name = "Grow-And-Rotate"
author = "9volt"
description = "Expand syl size and rotate it, then return to normal over the syl's duration"
transform = false
params = [
    "Scale", "Rotation"
]
format = "?t($start, $mid, ?fscx${Scale}?fscy${Scale}?frz${Rotation})?t($mid, $end, ?fscx100?fscy100?frz0)"
```

### Explanation of the format

```toml
name = "Grow-And-Rotate"
author = "9volt"
description = "Expand syl size and rotate it, then return to normal over the syl's duration"
```

Pretty self-explanitory. The name of the plugin will be used in the toolbox, and the description will appear as a tooltip when the toolbox entry is hovered over.

```toml
transform = false
```

This property denotes if this plugin may be used within a transform event. For most plugins, this will be `false`, as the plugin will supply its own transform tags or contain other tags, like `\move`, which cannot be used within a transform event.

```toml
params = [
    "Scale", "Rotation"
]
```

Here we list all the variables that will be supplied by the user. In this example, the user will supply the scale percentage and angle of rotation. This could easily be expanded to include additional variables, like a variable mid-point to the effect or separate X and Y scale values.

```toml
format = "?t($start, $mid, ?fscx${Scale}?fscy${Scale}?frz${Rotation})?t($mid, $end, ?fscx100?fscy100?frz0)"
```

The final part to the plugin is the format definition. Here, the format for the ASS tags to be generated by the plugin are laid out, along with any variables needed. 

The backslash `\` should be replaced with a `?` in the format string to avoid issues with escape characters. The question marks will automatically be replaced with backslashes when the final ASS code is generated.

Variables are case-sensitive, and follow a format similar to f-strings in Python, which is `${VariableName}`.

### Plugin Result

If the example plugin were in use, and the user supplied values of `120` for Scale and `15` for Rotation, KFX-GUI would generate the following ASS code, which would be included along with the results from all other actions present on that line:

```
\t($start, $mid, \fscx120\fscy120\frz15)\t($mid, $end, \fscx100\fscy100\frz0)
```
